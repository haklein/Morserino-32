# Documentation in other languages

Here you can find documents that have been translated by Morserino-32 users. Unfortunately these documents do not always follow the documentation standards of the German and English version.

## How to translate Documentation

The originaly assembly instructions are created as plain ASCII documents with Markdown markups. The user manuals are created as plain ASCII documents with asciidoc markups.

Both these formats allow **automatic** generation of nicely formatted pdf documents (results from markdown are OK, results from asciidoc are really good).

In order to achieve a consistent look and feel across all languages, and also to make it easer to incorporate subsequent changes, you must translate the source document, using any plain text editor. DO NOT FORMAT THE DOCUMENTS WITH A WORD PROCESSOR!
So please translate and submit a .md file for the assembly instructions, and a .adoc file for the user manual. Do not submit Word (.docx) or pdf documents!

For historic reasons I accept pdf documents that have been submitted before January 31, 2020. After that date, only .md and .adoc files will be accepted in this GitHub repository!

All translated documents conforming to markdown and asciidoc rules will be incorporated into the main documentation folders, where the English and German documents already reside. This means that this directory will not be maintained anymore after January 2020.
